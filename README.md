   * I built a Turing Complete CPU in that game from NAND gates in 14 hours when I had zero experience in computer architecture. I am more proud of it than whatever internship or 2nd highest GPA in my program or sth like that. Gonna twitch a speed run of it soon.

I am also doing research involving Bluespec hardware dev, C, and shell scripting. The paper is not published yet so it's a secret. :P

## More

<details>
<summary><strong>In case you wonder why there's so much different stuff on my resume</strong></summary>
<br>
<p>First, I find different kinds of pleasure in different fields of programming.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The pleasure of solving puzzles</strong>: Leetcoding, coding games.</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of building, e.g. playing LEGO</strong>: application development, development of large-scale stuff.</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of talking with the agency of truth that seldom lies unless it's too hot</strong>: hardware development, coding in assembly.</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of retrospecting how the world runs and then modeling it</strong>: OOP</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of hitting Enter</strong>: type-strict languages</li>
</ol>

<p>And I just learn things fast and like to explore random stuff. Like I spent a Saturday learning discord bot API and wrote one to tell my bf to fuck off isn't that awesome?</p>

Update: many of my self-hosted web services above are out of service because all my free credits in all the common cloud providers run out. One more reason to find a job, right?
