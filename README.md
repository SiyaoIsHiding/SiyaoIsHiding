# Hello from Siyao (Jane) He :wave:
I do a lot of open-source contributions to gain experience, receive guidance from the seniors, make an impact, and have fun without those online assessments and rounds of interviews.
## Personal Projects & Contributions
### Application Layer

  * :octocat:&nbsp; [CampusOfferFrontend](https://github.com/SiyaoIsHiding/CampusOfferFrontend) & :octocat:&nbsp;[CampusOfferBackend](https://github.com/SiyaoIsHiding/CampusOfferBackend)
    * The eBay for Campus!
    * Android Kotlin - Node.js - MySQL - Azure
  * :octocat:&nbsp; [QuizApp](https://github.com/SiyaoIsHiding/QuizApp)
    * iOS Swift
* Game Development (All in Unity 2D C#)
  * :video_game: [Order Up!](https://madjuse.itch.io/order-up)
    * A single-player Overcooked! where you have to switch roles between the chef and the waiter
  * :video_game: [Take One](https://ginvr.itch.io/take-one)
    * Spray the garden hose to the kids taking more than 1 candy!
* Full-Stack Web Development
  * :octocat:&nbsp; [Fuck-off as a Service](https://github.com/SiyaoIsHiding/foaas) :globe_with_meridians: [Endpoint & Doc](https://fuckoffasaservice.azurewebsites.net/)
    * Providing a modern, RESTful, scalable solution to the common problem of telling people to fuck off.
    * I swear I am mentally healthy I did this only for fun.
    * Node.js - Azure
  * :octocat:&nbsp; [MailBag](https://github.com/SiyaoIsHiding/mailbag)
    * React.js (TypeScript) - Node.js - NeDB (NoSQL)

### Platform Layer
* Ported R to RISC-V CPU and linked with faster linear algebra library
  * Contributed a small [fix](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2023-February/082382.htmls) to base R future releases
* :octocat:&nbsp; [QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb), a time-series database in java
  * :new: [PR](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3006): Implemented the backslash escape mechanism to let the database user search for texts with special characters
* :wrench: [GitHub Action r-asymptotic-testing](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/r-asymptotic-testing)
  * A Continuous Integration tool to test your R package on a PR with various input data sizes and leave messages in the PR if significant performance regression or improvements are detected.
* :octocat:&nbsp; [DBeaver](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver), a universal database tool and SQL client in java
  * :new: [PR](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/pull/19743): Fix a small bug when generating UUID for multiple rows in a table

### Hardware Layer
Tbh not much to share. I am a beginner but making progress fast.

[Turing Complete](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/) is a game/tutorial to build CPUs at the transistor level with a GUI IDE, which took me into this field in Dec last year. I built a Turing Complete CPU in that game from NAND gates in 14 hours.

I am self-learning FPGA (VHDL) now and hopefully I will develop a RISC-V instruction to calculate the great circle distances for an astronomical application later this year.

<summary><strong>In case you wonder why there's so much different stuff on my resume</strong></summary>
<br>
<p>First, I am a career changer, so I started in the application layer and I made my way down.</p>
<p>Second, I find different kinds of pleasure in different fields of programming.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The pleasure of solving puzzles</strong>: Leetcoding, coding games.</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of building, e.g. playing LEGO</strong>: application development, development of large-scale stuff.</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of talking with the agency of truth that seldom lies unless it's too hot</strong>: hardware development, coding in assembly.</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of retrospecting how the world runs and then modeling it</strong>: OOP</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of hitting Enter</strong>: type-strict languages</li>
</ol>
