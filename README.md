# Hello from Siyao (Jane) He :wave:
I do a lot of open-source contributions to gain experience, receive guidance from the seniors, make an impact, and have fun without those online assessments and rounds of interviews.
## Personal Projects & Contributions

### Platform Layer
* Ported R to RISC-V CPU and linked with faster linear algebra library
  * Contributed a small [fix](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2023-February/082382.htmls) to base R future releases
* :octocat:&nbsp; [QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb), a time-series database in java
  * :new: [PR](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3006): Implemented the backslash escape mechanism to let the database user search for texts with special characters
* :wrench: [GitHub Action r-asymptotic-testing](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/r-asymptotic-testing)
  * A Continuous Integration tool to test your R package on a PR with various input data sizes and leave messages in the PR if significant performance regression or improvements are detected.

### Hardware Layer
Tbh not much to share. I am a beginner but making progress fast.

[Turing Complete](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/) is a game/tutorial to build CPUs at the transistor level with a GUI IDE, which took me into this field in Dec last year. I built a Turing Complete CPU in that game from NAND gates in 14 hours, and I have been trying my best to step into this industry since then.

I am self-learning FPGA (VHDL) now and I will develop a small RISC-V instruction set extension to calculate the great circle distances later this year.

<summary><strong>In case you wonder why there's so much irrelevant stuff on my resume</strong></summary>
<br>
<p>First, I believe a good software engineer always cares about the hardware. If I really care about the performance of my application, I'mma optimize it from the logic gates.</p>
<p>Second, I find different kinds of pleasure in different fields of programming.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The pleasure of solving puzzles</strong>: Leetcoding, coding games.</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of building, e.g. playing LEGO</strong>: application development, development of large-scale stuff.</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of talking with the agency of truth that seldom lies unless it's too hot</strong>: hardware development.</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of retrospecting how the world runs and then modeling it</strong>: OOP</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure of hitting Enter</strong>: type-strict languages</li>
</ol>
